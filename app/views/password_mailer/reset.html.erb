    <p>Hi <%= params[:user].email %>,</p>

    <p>Someone requested a reset of your password.</p>

    <p>If this was you, click the link below to reset your password. The link will expire in 15 minutes:</p>

    <%= password_reset_edit_url(token: @token, only_path: true) %>

    <p>If you did not request a password reset, please ignore this email.</p>

    <p>Best regards,<br>Your Company Name</p>

<%# we are using password_reset_edit_url, becuase since we are calling from the view , if we use only 
  path instead of url, it will take only the path that is /password_reset/edit . instead by using the 
url we are directly calling the url %>
